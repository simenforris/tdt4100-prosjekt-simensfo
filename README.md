## Rules
WarPoker is a game of War where the winner is decided through Poker rules. The winner gets all cards in play. If there is a tie all played cards get added to the war cards pile, and the next winner gets all played cards in addition to the war cards. 

Points are given as follows:
- Straight Flush: 6 points
- Three of a kind: 5 points
- Straight: 4 points
- Flush: 3 points
- Pair: 2 points
- Nothing: 1 point

High card is not counted. A pair of 2 is worth the same as a pair of 10
